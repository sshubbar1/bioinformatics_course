## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Task 1
```{r, comment=NA}
sum(5:55)
```


## Task 2
```{r, comment=NA}
sumfun <- function(n) {sum(5:n)}
sumfun(10)
sumfun(20)
sumfun(100)
```


## Task 3
```{r, comment=NA}
Fibonacci <-numeric(12)
Fibonacci[1] <- Fibonacci[2] <- 1
for(i in 3:12) {Fibonacci[i] <- Fibonacci[i-2] + Fibonacci[i-1]}
print(Fibonacci)
```


## Task 4
```{r, comment=NA}
library(ggplot2)
data <- mtcars
data$gear <- as.factor(data$gear)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(gear), y = mpg, fill=gear)) + geom_boxplot()
```


## Task 5
```{r, comment=NA}
distance <- lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data =cars)
summary(distance)
```
Answers for task 5:

Fitted slope is 3.9324

Intercept of the line is -17.5791

Standard deviation for distance is 6.7584 and 

Standard deviation for speed is 0.4155


## Task 6
```{r, comment=NA}
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + 
geom_point(color='#7F0000', size = 2) + xlim(c(0, 25)) + 
geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE, color='#2C3E50') + 
labs(title='Linear Relationship between speed and breaking distance', x='Speed (mph)', y='Breaking Distance (ft)')
```


## Task 7
```{r, comment=NA}
library(ggplot2)
data("cars")
car_speed <- cars$speed + (5280/3600)
lm_l <- lm(dist ~  0 + car_speed + I(car_speed^2), cars)
summary(lm_l) 

y <- cars$dist
x <- cars$car_speed
ggplot(cars, aes(car_speed, dist)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula="y~0+x+I(x^2)") + labs(title = "The average reaction time for driver to start breaking", x="Car Speed in seconds", y="Distance (ft)")
```
The formula: y~0+x+I(x^2) gives a linear graph model but it also provides the line with the best fit of the line (due to the 0 added in the formula).

Answer task 7: According to the results given, the slop of the graph is 0.78282 (car_speed). It is relatively close to 1.0 and is therefore a reasonable time for the driver to start breaking his car.
